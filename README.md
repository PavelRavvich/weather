The program shows the weather according to the current GPS coordinates. The coordinates are taken from the whereami program (Mac). [About whereami](https://github.com/robmathers/WhereAmI).

Getting weather by coordinates occurs in the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) service.

To run, use python 3.10.5 (external libraries are not required for the application to work), put the API key in `config.py` to access OpenWeather and run:

`./weather`
The weather file is an executable file with python code.
